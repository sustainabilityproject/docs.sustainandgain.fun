## A Range of Roles for Your Preferences
Our roles enable you to administer AND participate in equal measure! You can be promoted or demoted on leaderboards according to your position on these league hierarchies.

At our heart is an authentic community built on trust- join us today, experience growth while hearing about other's unique stories and share yours too!

## Visibility

A league may either be public or private. If a league is public, it will display to all users (including those not logged in) and all members and points will be public.

If a league is private, it will not show on the public page and members will remain private.
