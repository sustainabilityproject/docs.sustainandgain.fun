# Roles

There are three different user roles in Sustain and Gain:
- Player
- Staff
- Gamekeeper

## Player

Player is the default row given to a user after registration. They have the ability to play each part of the game.

## Staff

A staff member extends permissions from player by adding access to the reported area, where a staff member is able to either restore a reported task to mark it as completed or delete a reported task

## Gamekeeper

Gamekeeper is the role with the most privileges. Gamekeepers are able to manage every aspect of the game (i.e. Tasks, Profiles, Leagues) all from the Gamekeeper area (/gamekeeper)
