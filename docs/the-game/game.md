# Task Validation
Tasks are validated on a decentralised basis. This keeps the workload low for staff members and makes the system scalable to a large cohort of users. A task will be moved from pending to completed upon the following conditions being met:
- The post receives three likes.
- The post has existed on the feed for 1 week.
- The computer vision system determines that the image satisfies the task description.
- A staff member restores the previously reported post.

Points are awarded upon tasks being assigned the completed tag.
