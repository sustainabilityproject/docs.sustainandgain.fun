## A Platform Built on Trust
We take accountability seriously at all times- if a task doesn't live up to requirements or has evidence that seems questionable, report it quickly using our "Report Task" button feature! Our designated staff will then review it right away and determine the next course of action.

We believe in creating an enjoyable community built around honesty, authenticity and accountability - join us today, be part of something special!
